# Sf2 Resistance

## Installation

Currently we're pulling event information from Meetup. You'll need to add your
API key to `env.js`:

```
cp env.js.example env.js
# Edit env.js and add your meetup API key to the `meetupApikey` property
```

```
npm install
npm start
# In a new shell...
react-native run-ios
```

If ðŸ’© goes bad, clear all the caches and start again

```
./nukeit
```
